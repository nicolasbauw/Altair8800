This is a teletype emulator, written for my [8080 emulator](https://crates.io/crates/intel8080).
It emulates a teletype interfaced on a 88-SIO board running on an Altair 8800. The 8080 processor speed is approximately 2 Mhz.

To install:
```text
cargo install teletype
```

You can run an Altair binary, for example BASIC 3.2 :
```
teletype 4kbas32.bin
```

It has been tested with the echo test routine and the Altair BASIC 3.2:
```
‚ùØ teletype ~/Dev/4kbas32.bin 

MEMORY SIZE? 8192
TERMINAL WIDTH? 
WANT SIN? N
WANT RND? N
WANT SQR? N

5068 BYTES FREE

BASIC VERSION 3.2
[4K VERSION]

OK
```
The escape key opens a menu, from which you can:
- Quit the emulator without having to press CTRL-C
- Load a file from you disk. This "injects" the text of the file into the teletype and is very convenient to load a BASIC program, since BASIC 3.2 does not provide disk operation commands.

Pressing ESC a second time quits the menu.
